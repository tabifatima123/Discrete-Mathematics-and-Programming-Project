📊 Graph Classification Using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)


📌 Project Overview


This project focuses on graph classification using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It demonstrates how graph-structured data can be learned and classified by leveraging relationships between nodes and edges rather than treating data as independent points.

🧠 Motivation


Traditional machine learning models struggle with relational data. GNNs are designed to operate directly on graphs, making them suitable for tasks where structure and connectivity play a key role, such as social networks, molecular graphs, and knowledge graphs.

📐 Concepts Used


Graph theory (nodes, edges, adjacency)

Discrete mathematics foundations

Graph representation learning

Neural network–based classification

⚙️ Methodology


Graphs are represented using nodes and edges

Node features are propagated through the graph

Learned graph embeddings are used for classification

The model captures both structural and feature-based information
